    `Welcome to StackExchange Bounties, a decentralized application (dapp)
    <span>powered by <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> 
    and <a href="http://www.oraclize.it/" target="_blank">Oraclize</a></span>.
    This dapp allows you to sponsor questions located on 
    <a href="https://www.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">StackExchange</a> with real
    money. Press next to view a tutorial or close this window to begin viewing bounties.`,

    `StackExchange Bounties runs on <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. 
    In order to sponsor or submit questions, you need a way to access the network. 
    For beginners, we recommend installing the chrome extension 
    <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">MetaMask</a>. 
    More advanced users can connect to a specific node in Advanced Settings.`,

    `You don't need to connect to Ethereum to view questions. However, you will need to
    do this in order to sponsor or submit questions. Connect to Ethereum with 
    <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> by simply creating a new
    vault and signing in. Refresh the page once you've signed in.
    This page should say "Found an unlocked account" when you're connected.`,

    `Once you're connected, you can submit a new question with a bounty by clicking
    "Submit a new question", located at the top of the web page. You can sponsor questions
    by clicking on them and then clicking "Sponsor this question" on the detail page.`,

    `That's all! Happy bounty hunting!`
